This is my first project in Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity

Project Overview

In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
first I explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, optimized the model with the best suited model.
Finally, explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given
and presented it as a solution to CharityML.
