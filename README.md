## Project Overview

Applying supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

Start with exploring the data to learn how the census data is recorded, and applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 

Then evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and compare between the models with respect time and accuracy of each model,
consider which is best suited for the solution, and optimized the model with the best suited parameters.

Finally, explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given,
and presented it as a solution to CharityML.
